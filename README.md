This is humble project of mine featuring MixItUp filtering plugin built from HTML5 boilerplate. It also features a number of other plugins. It is still in it's early stages and currently I am working on resolving multifiltering issues with MixItUp. It's totaly on my part, being very bad with all things Javascript. So any help on that matter would be most welcome.

Thank you.
