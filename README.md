Message to kind people of MixItUp:

- I can't get my filters to behave the way I want. Filters of the same "row" shouldn't crash the filter.
For example, user should be able to activate "seaside", then click bellow on "apartments" and on "luxury villas"
and get all apartments and luxury villas available on seaside.

Right now, if user clicks on "seaside" and clicks bellow on "apartments" he will get seaside apartments, but if he adds
"luxury villas" filter crashes on me.

Thanks for any help you can provide in advance.

Kind regards from Serbia.
